# PLOTLY_Interactive-Web-Visualizations

## Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

### Step 1 - Plotly.js

Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboard.

* Create a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples.

  * Use `sample_values` as the values for the PIE chart.

  * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the pie chart.

  * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.


* Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the y values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

  * Use `otu_labels` for the text values.


* Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`

  * Display each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

* Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

### Step 2 - Heroku

Deploy your Flask app to Heroku.

* You can use the provided sqlite file for the database.


### Flask API

Use Flask API starter code to serve the data needed for your plots.

* Test your routes by visiting each one in the browser.

### Hints

* Don't forget to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you start your server.

* Use `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.
